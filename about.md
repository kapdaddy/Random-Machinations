  Welcome to Random Machinations!
</p>

Over the years I have developed many blogs and websites mainly using Wordpress and along the lines of aiming for a particular niche. This has never really worked out well and the web is literally littered by my abandoned websites. My aim here is to create my own personal website without trying to target any kind of niche. I just want to write about the random things I like doing with my spare time and the random things going on in my life hence the name "Random Machinations". I'm also trying to learn web design and coding so I'm taking things back to basics and actually going to try to understand how a site works.

## A bit about the site design

I'm creating my site at GitHub pages. I started out using the automatic page generator then decided to try [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com), a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) template to create my site. 

I want to learn all about <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">Markdown</a>, and work on designing my own template.</p>

The [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com) theme is designed by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo). The overall theme is built on [Poole](http://getpoole.com/) - a framework for Jekyll sites. Learn more and contribute on [GitHub](https://github.com/poole).

Some fun facts about the setup of [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com) from [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo):

* Built for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
* Developed on GitHub and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
* Coded with [Sublime Text 2](http://sublimetext.org), an amazing code editor
* Designed and developed while listening to music like [Blood Bros Trilogy](https://soundcloud.com/maddecent/sets/blood-bros-series)
