<p>Over the years I have developed many blogs and websites mainly using Wordpress and along the lines of aiming for a particular niche. This has never really worked out well and the web is literally littered by my abandoned websites. My aim here is to create my own personal website without trying to target any kind of niche. I just want to write about the random things I like doing with my spare time and the random things going on in my life hence the name "Random Machinations". I'm also trying to learn web design and coding so I'm taking things back to basics and actually going to try to understand how a site works.</p> 

<p>I'm creating my site at GitHub pages at first using the automatic page generator but later I'm hoping to put Jekyll to good use in creating a great site. I want to learn all about <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">Markdown</a>, and work on designing my own template.</p>
