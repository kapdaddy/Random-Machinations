I was on the look out for some new earphones for my morning walk to work recently. I was going to get another set of SoundMagic Earphones after having a good experience of these in the past. I stumbled across these earphones on Amazon - the Betron DC950s. They seemed to have a great range of features at a very good price so I thought I'd give them a go. I've tried a lot of different brands over the past few years including Sennheiser and also Xiaomi but I think the best I've had were the SoundMagic ones so I wasn't completely against trying a new, relatively unknown brand. 

A little while after they arrived I got an email through Amazon from Betron asking for a review so I agreed to do this on my own site* though I purchased them myself and wasn't asked for a review until after my purchase.

I chose the ones with the inline microphone and volume control though I've never 

Here's a picture of the earphones:

### Features

The listing on Amazon gives these features:

* Gold plated 3.5mm plug
* 3.93ft(1.2m) flat, tangle-free cable
* Detachable cable - the earbuds can be removed from the cable 
* 11.5mm Neodymium driver units
* Wide frequency response (20Hz - 20kHz)
* Robust Metal Design
* Balanced sound output
* Comfortable, even for prolonged listening
* Come with a range of accesories
* Silicone eartips (S/M/L)
* Cable clip
* Travel pouch
* 1 Year Warranty, 30 Days Money back guarantee

### Features in depth

Quite a few of the features listed are now fairly standard such as the gold plated plug and neodymium driver. The flat cable is a little more unusual but I've seen it a few times before and have to say it really works well; I've had these in my jacket pocket for a few weeks now and can easily get them out with little fuss. The silicone eartips are also very common these days and the ones supplied with the Betron DC950s are just fine. In fact they fit me better than others I've had in the past. I think, though, these are definitely a part where different people will have a different experience.

### The detachable cable

This was a feature which drew me to buy these earbuds over my initial choice of getting more SoundMagic ones. I have to say it's probably more of a gimmick than being something that's actually useful. In fact I've tried to look for a replacement cable online with no success. I'd love to know what the reason behind the detachable cable is.

### The sound

This is the main reason for choosing one set of headphones over another isn't it? Well the sound from the Betron DC950s didn't disappoint me. I've tried these with classical tracks, movie soundtracks like the Inception soundtrack, rock, pop and electronic music (I rediscovered C2C after I'd bought these). I have to say they give remarkably full and pleasing sound whatever you throw at them.

### Conclusion

Overall I'd recommend the Betron DC950s as a great value set of earphones. I think a lot of brands out there do offer a similar level of sound quality for the price, but I think what this has shown me is to look beyond the usual suspects such as Sony and Sennheiser to get a product that's equivalent or better without the premium price tag.


*As an aside I love reviewing things. With one of my first websites I wanted to write a whole series of reviews of different products and services, which I eventually sold on when I got a little too busy at university. My one bugbear with that site was never being accepted on the Amazon Affiliates program despite having lots of good posts and running the site for some time. As a result I'm now a little reluctant to review on Amazon as I think I'm just adding content and value to Amazon and not really gaining anything. I myself often search for reviews off Amazon when I'm buying something so I don't think I'm particularly disadvantaging products or buyers.
