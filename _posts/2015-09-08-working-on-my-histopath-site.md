title: Working on My Histopath Site... Plus Python Dreams
---

When I'm not tinkering with computers and such I'm working as a histopathology trainee so as well as my [random machinations](http://www.randommachinations.com/) I'm also currently working on a site to use as a histopathology log. I have a tendency to jot down little bits of learning on scraps of paper so my aim is to try to put these all online instead.

My new site is [histopathlog.com](http://www.histopathlog.com/). This is very much a work in progress but eventually I hope I'll have a good resource of notes and links to papers etc. that I'll be able to use to look up things and revise from. The big dream is a searchable database of these notes and I'm wondering if this is something I can achieve with Python. It probably is, but then is that using a sledgehammer to crack a nut? In the meantime I'm using a Jekyll-powered site to turn my notes into something that can be put up online.
