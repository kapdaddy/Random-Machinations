Things have been a little quiet here. OK things have been very quiet here. Looking back I can see the last post was way back in November last year! I did have a whole series of posts I was working on but life just got in the way. 

### Life

The main things that have been going on have been revising for my postgraduate exams in Histopathology and becoming a father. Who would have thought just how all-consuming an experience this would be? Anyhow the dust has settled somewhat and now I want to get back into blogging.

### Posts in Progress

To give you a flavour of what I had been up to:

* Reviewing Auto Finesse Total Interior cleaner - not sure whether I have a "Before" picture of my mouldy car though
* Moving my other websites from NearlyFreeSpeech to DigitalOcean
* Trying out Pelican as a Python powered static site generator
* Resurrecting my old Nexus 7 with Omnirom

### Check Back for More Random Machinations

I sincerely hope normal service will be resumed here very soon. I'm also thinking of throwing in more topical posts about the news and science and technology reporting as these are things that really interest me especially the shoddy reporting of research in science and medicine. So yes,check back for more random machinations soon.
