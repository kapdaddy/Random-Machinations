Just checked and seen that I haven't actually blogged here since back in mid-March! I'd said at that time I was busy with exams and becoming a new father but that I was ready to get back into blogging. How wrong I was! It's true that I had a whole series of posts in progress; things that progressed further still though and some of what I wanted to blog about has changed.

At the time I was moving some websites from NearlyFreeSpeech to [DigitalOcean](http://www.digitalocean.com/). Been there and done that and now, together with trying out a static site generator called Pelican, I'm switching from DigitalOcean to hosting static sites on Amazon S3; I just can't be bothered with the hassle of maintaining a server when all I want is to host static files. It just doesn't make sense.

I've also been learning to code in Python. It's something I've been wanting to learn for a year now, but haven't got round to it. More on that very soon... Finally I'm trying out a different web host called [DjangoEurope](http://djangoeurope.com/). Django is a web framework built with Python and I'm hoping to use it to develop my histopathology site.

Another update very soon. This time I promise!
