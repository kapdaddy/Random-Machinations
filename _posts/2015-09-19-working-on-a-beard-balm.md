I first got into growing a beard during Movember of last year. The moustache wasn't a good look but everyone suggested I hide the moustache inside a beard only to reveal it at the end of the month. The beard, however, decided to stay. It's the perfect accessory for the aspiring pathologist - check out the great Rudolf Virchow sporting a fine beard.
