title: Welcome to Random Machinations

Random Machinations is my own personal website to document my learnings about life and things I like doing in my time off. 

I'll have posts about:

* Web design
* Graphic design and illustration
* Coding (mainly Python)
* Cooking
* Work
* Crochet
* My experiments with the Raspberry Pi
* News, reviews and opinions
* All those random things you learn through life
