title: Krispy Kreme Peanut Butter Kreme

So the title of this post is the Krispy Kreme Peanut Butter Kreme but what I want to try to do is see how to get images into my posts as well as write about my love of doughnuts.

So here we go!

We went to get some things for the new bathroom from Ikea and stopped off for Krispy Kremes on the way home. Now I love all doughnuts and wanted the classic glazed ring doughnut but got persuaded into buying something more unusual - the Reese's Peanut Butter Kreme. It was nice but I think I still prefer either the original kreme filling or the glazed ring doughnut because I think I was expecting a light mixture of kreme and peanut butter instead of just the peanut butter.
