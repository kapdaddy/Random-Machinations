My latest project is to build my own computer. It's not so much that I want the latest and fastest processor or that I'm going to go crazy overclocking it etc. it's just that I want to build it to my own specifications and be able to modify it as and when I get more money for newer parts. So at the moment I have a laptop from around 2010 back when I was at university and it's starting to annoy me with how slow it gets. I could try to upgrade the RAM and maybe add a SSD but it's so old that the RAM for example will not be value for money.

I had looked at things like the [Intel Compute Stick](http://www.ebuyer.com/713050-intel-compute-stick-boxstck1a32wfc) and small barebones boxes like [this](http://www.ebuyer.com/654664-gigabyte-brix-gb-bxbt-2807-baytrail-celeron-n2807-hdmi-barebone-gb-bxbt-2807) but then I think I'd just be limiting myself again just like having a laptop.

So I'm going to try to get all the parts together to build it myself. At the moment I've picked out this case as my top pick:

[Cooler Master Elite 130](http://www.cclonline.com/product/123304/RC-130-KKN1/Cases/Cooler-Master-Elite-130-Mini-ITX-Mini-Cube-Case-USB3-0-with-120-Radiator-Support/CAS0930/)

It's compact and looks good but takes a full size power supply and can fit a proper graphics card and 3 hard drives or 5 solid-state drives. The only issue I can foresee is the ITX motherboard - I'd probably end up needing to spend loads to get a really good one or else get a cheaper one using the AMD AM1 platform. The main draw for me is the possibility to upgrade when I have more money to do so.
