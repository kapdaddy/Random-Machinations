title: Victorian Plumbing Bathroom Review
---

So we moved into our house more or less a year ago. It was all good apart from the bathroom, which was an eyesore of pink tiles, flowery accents and a 1970s shell suite. The plan always was to refurbish this as soon as possible but what with one thing and another we didn't get round to it until now. We had one plumber who offered to supply and fit the bathroom for £4200, another quote of nearly £9000 and someone else who quoted £1900 to fit the bathroom which we would have to supply ourselves. This was what we went for in the end thinking that we would save some money this way.
