title: Victorian Plumbing Bathroom Review and Other Useful Tips
---

So we moved into our house more or less a year ago. It was all good apart from the bathroom, which was an eyesore of pink tiles, flowery accents and a 1970s shell suite. The plan always was to refurbish this as soon as possible but what with one thing and another we didn't get round to it until now. We had one plumber who offered to supply and fit the bathroom for £4200, another quote of nearly £9000 and someone else who quoted £1900 to fit the bathroom which we would have to supply ourselves. This was what we went for in the end thinking that we would save some money this way.

### Victoria Plum vs Victorian Plumbing

This was really confusing! There are two companies with very similar offerings - Victoria Plum and Victorian Plumbing. Both are online, offer discounted bathrooms and a variety of delivery services. We went for Victorian Plumbing in the end because they offered a number of branded products eg. the Bristan taps and shower that I was after rather than their own generic products. I went for the next day delivery service, which was delivered by Palletways. I can't fault their service. It arrived on time and in perfect condition. I'd read some negative reviews online about the delivery aspect, so thought I could give my opinion of this. 

### Screwfix

I love screwfix! I ordered the heated towel rail and downlights from screwfix. Definitely the way to go if you know what you want. I was able to get IP65 (you need these for installing into a bathroom or anywhere where the electrics could get sprayed by water) downlights including LED bulbs for £16.99 a piece. Even the plumber and electrician thought these were a bargain.

### Painting ceilings

My top tip - don't water down your paint. I gave the newly-plastered ceiling a coat of watered-down paint at first but this looked awful. Using the paint as it was from the tin worked so much better and with less chance of drips too.
