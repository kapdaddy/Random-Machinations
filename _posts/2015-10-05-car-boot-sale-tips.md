So we went to a car boot sale at the weekend to sell some, or should I say most, of the stuff we had in our spare room. It was a really interesting experience to see what sold well and to chat with the buyers.

Here's a picture of our table:

I had a whole load of books on psychology, art, illustration and a few classic novels such as "Animal Farm" and "Notes From the Underground". It was really amazing that these went so quickly. The best and most unexpected sellers were books on hypnosis, creative visualisation, and neurolinguistic programming. One buyer even asked if I had any more, but I had to tell him those had sold earlier on. It did feel kind of good that those were going to good homes with people who would enjoy and learn from them. The other surprise sellers were some of the things I'd bought on my various holidays such as my Turkish pottery, Malaysian bamboo mug and miniature Samoan kava bowl. We even had one couple come over and comment that we had a really interesting assortment of items.

### My Car Boot Tips

1. Take a float - we had around Â£35 in pound coins, 50p, 20p and 10p
2. Take carrier bags - lots of people were asking for them
3. Get there early to get a good pitch - we got up at 5am for a 6am start
4. As a corollary: take a powerful torch to help set up in the early morning
5. Have a sturdy table - we had this one from ScrewFix: [Professional MDF Top Pasting Table 2000 x 560 x 800mm](http://www.screwfix.com/p/professional-mdf-top-pasting-table-2000-x-560-x-800mm/75185)
6. Don't rush into sales. We were mobbed by people with torches as soon as we opened the boot like a scene from a zombie movie, but these were professional buyers who would drive a really hard bargain.
7. But don't be reluctant to sell if people seem interested at first but then walk away when they hear the price.

So if you need to clear some space quickly and don't mind getting up early give it a go. I do think I could have got more for some things with eBay etc but that takes more time and a lot more effort with packing things and taking them down to the Post Office.
